Automatically generating images for text is a fascinating but challenging research area in Machine Learning. There are several papers proposed to generate images of one single object for several descriptive sentences. In this project, we used the state-of-the-art text-to-image algorithm to generate illustrations for fairy tales, which involve more complex scenes.
